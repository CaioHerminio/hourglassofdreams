    /*
    This was based on a TedTalk by Josh Kaufman, who said that it takes 20 hours to learn a new skill and become average at it.
    I also noticed that most courses on 3D softwares, game development and programming also have a duration of 20-30 hours.
    Because of that, I decided to use 25 hours as a base for this calculation. 
    Wanna learn something new and get good enough at it? 25 hours is a good number to start with.
    Wanna become pro? 50-100 hours is a good reference.
    Wanna be the best in the world, the ultimate master? Then you use the famous 10,000 hours rule.
    But don't forget that you DON'T NEED 10 thousand hours to be happy with your skill and find a job with it.
