<h1>‚è≥Hourglass of Dreams ‚Äì Project 2 of The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>Learning any new skill often feels overwhelming, especially when we worry about how long it will take to get good enough, or IF we will get good enough. This anxiety about the future causes us to procrastinate and abandon projects halfway through. This is a problem I have faced many times throughout my life, and many of my fellow artists have faced it as well. Now that I'm studying programming with a focus on the gaming industry, I don't want to make the same mistake of stopping fighting in the present because I'm afraid of the future.</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>My goal was to build a simple calculator that tells users how long it would take to become ‚Äúaverage‚Äù at a skill based on their weekly dedication. I wanted the tool to be inspiring and mythic, turning a technical calculation into a fun storytelling experience.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>
<p>I built the Hourglass of Dreams, an interactive program that uses input (goal, days/week, hours/day) to estimate how many days, weeks, or months are needed to reach 25 hours of practice. This number was chosen based on insights from a Josh Kaufman‚Äôs TED Talk who debunked the myth that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to master something. In practice, it only takes 20 hours to become average at any skill. It takes a lifetime to become a master, but you don't have to wait that long to become good at something. Based on this and the fact that several programming and digital art courses last between 20-30 hours, I've determined that 25 is a good amount to base our studies on.</p>

<h3>Result</h3>
<p>This is the second project in The Code Fool‚Äôs Journey, exploring basic arithmetic operations, user input, and practical problem-solving. The program is poetic and motivational, transforming something technical into something memorable.</p>

<h2>Multi-Language Learning Philosophy</h2>
<p>Just like the first project, this one is being developed in Python, JavaScript, and C++. I‚Äôm studying these three languages simultaneously to avoid becoming too attached to the quirks of just one. This method helps me grasp the core logic of programming ‚Äî which is universal across languages ‚Äî rather than memorizing syntax. By rewriting the same project in multiple languages, I reinforce my understanding of structures, variables, functions, and flow ‚Äî while also appreciating the expressive power of each language.</p>

<h2>Project Scope: Hourglass of Dreams</h2>
<p>Core concepts covered (in addition to those already seen in the previous project and returning in this one):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic Operations</li>
  <li>Basic logic</li>
  <li>Storytelling</li>
</ul>

<h1>About the Code Fool's Journey</h1>
<p>The Fool's Journey is similar to Joseph Campbell‚Äôs famous Hero‚Äôs Journey, but instead of 12 stages, it follows 22 stages, based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each card represents an archetype in the evolution of the protagonist, the Fool, who embarks on a path toward knowledge and personal power, just like programmers and artists. Here, each project increases in complexity and covered concepts, from simple variables and data types to APIs, Memory Management, Databases and GUI.</p>

<h1>Feel Free to Fork the Journey</h1>
<p>If you find this helpful for learning or teaching, you're welcome to fork, improve, or remix it in your own way. The Fool‚Äôs path is yours to walk ‚Äî and code ‚Äî however you like.üòä</p>
