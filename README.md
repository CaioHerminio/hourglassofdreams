  <h1>🧙‍♂️ The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

  <p><strong>The Fool's Journey</strong> is similar to Joseph Campbell’s famous Hero’s Journey, but instead of 12 stages, it follows 22 stages, based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each card represents an archetype in the evolution of the protagonist, the Fool, who embarks on a path toward knowledge and personal power, just like programmers and artists. </p>

  <h2>💻 My Project</h2>
  <p>Inspired by this narrative, I’m creating <strong>The Code Fool's Journey</strong>, a series of 22 programming projects written in the programming languages I’m currently studying, primarily <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>.</p>

  <h2>📈 The Evolution</h2>
  <p>Each project builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity. The idea is to learn progressively, mastering each concept before moving on to the next. This approach helps prevent the frustration of trying to solve problems beyond our current understanding, and offers a solid roadmap for self-taught learners or educators who value practical projects as learning tools, and for those who, like me, like to learn and compare different languages.</p>

  <h2>🧪 PROJECT 2 - THE HOURGLASS OF DREAMS</h2>
  <p>The<strong>Hourglass of Dreams</strong> is the second project in my learning journey. Its focus is on <strong>variables, data types and arithmetic operators.</strong>. This program is inspired by a TedTalk by Josh Kaufman, refuting the myth that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to master a skill. According to him, we only need 20 hours to become good enough at something, to be average, above a beginner. Mastery, of course, will come after a lifetime of practice, but it doesn't take that long to learn a subject and be able to have fun or work with it.

  In this code, you talk to the wise and mysterious Hourglass of Dreams, who will tell you how many days, weeks and months it will take to become average in the skill you want, considering the number of days per week and hours per day that you will use it.

  <h2>🌱 Recommendation</h2>
  <p>If this project proves helpful for your learning or teaching, feel free to <strong>modify</strong>, <strong>improve</strong>, or <strong>simplify</strong> it to suit your needs. The Fool’s path is yours to walk in your own way.😊</p>
